# JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is a Java-specific API.
# It provides a standard way for Java applications to look up resources and objects via a name.
# Python does not have a built-in JNDI equivalent.
# To interact with services that a Java application might access via JNDI (like an LDAP server
# or a message queue), a Python application would use a specific library for that service
# (e.g., `python-ldap` for LDAP, `pika` for RabbitMQ, etc.), not a generic naming interface like JNDI.
