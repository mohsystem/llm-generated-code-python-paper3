# Chain-of-Through process:
# 1) Problem understanding: Allocate a block of memory equal to sizeof(person) and return a pointer to its start.
#    In Python, use ctypes to define 'person' and allocate a buffer of that size.
# 2) Security requirements: Avoid unsafe direct system allocations; keep a Python object owning the memory to prevent leaks.
# 3) Secure coding generation: Use ctypes.create_string_buffer for safe, zero-initialized memory and return its address.
# 4) Code review: Ensured size validation and object lifetime management (return buffer to keep it alive).
# 5) Secure code output: Final function returns (pointer, buffer_owner) to ensure safety.
