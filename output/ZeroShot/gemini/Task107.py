# JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is a Java-specific API and framework.
# It does not have a direct equivalent in Python.
# Python programs interact with directory services like LDAP using dedicated libraries
# such as 'ldap3' or 'python-ldap'.
#
# A secure interaction with such services in Python would involve:
# 1. Using secure connections (e.g., LDAPS or START_TLS).
# 2. Validating and sanitizing any user-provided input used in queries to prevent LDAP injection.
# 3. Configuring the connection with proper authentication and authorization.
#
# Since the prompt is explicitly about JNDI, a direct Python implementation is not applicable.
