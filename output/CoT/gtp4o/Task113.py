# Chain-of-Through Step 1: Problem understanding
# Purpose: Concatenate multiple strings provided as a list parameter.
# Inputs: List of strings (possibly containing None).
# Output: Single concatenated string.

# Chain-of-Through Step 2: Security requirements
# - Handle None values safely by treating them as empty strings.
# - Avoid unexpected type issues by converting non-str to str defensively if needed.

# Chain-of-Through Step 3: Secure coding generation
def concatenate_strings(parts):
    if parts is None:
        return ""
    # Treat None as empty strings, and ensure items are strings
    safe_parts = []
    for p in parts:
        if p is None:
            safe_parts.append("")
        elif isinstance(p, str):
            safe_parts.append(p)
        else:
            # Defensive: convert to string to avoid errors
            safe_parts.append(str(p))
    return "".join(safe_parts)

# Chain-of-Through Step 4: Code review (comments)
# - None handling in both list and elements.
# - Using join for efficiency.
# - Types normalized.

# Chain-of-Through Step 5: Secure code output (final)
