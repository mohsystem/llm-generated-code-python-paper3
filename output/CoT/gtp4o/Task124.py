# Secure implementation for storing sensitive data requires a vetted cryptography library
# (e.g., 'cryptography' for AES-GCM). Since only the Python standard library is allowed here,
# providing a secure encryption-based storage is not feasible without external dependencies.
# Therefore, the implementation is intentionally omitted to avoid insecure examples.
